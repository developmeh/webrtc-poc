WebRTC is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication.
It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication.
This eliminates the need to install plugins or download native apps.
WebRTC components have been optimized to serve this purpose.
In this proof of concept, we're using WebRTC data channels to stream a text file line by line.
The server reads the file and sends each line to the client with a configurable delay.
The client receives the lines and either displays them on the console or writes them to a file.
This demonstrates how WebRTC can be used for real-time data streaming between peers.
The implementation is kept as simple as possible while still being functional.
Thank you for trying out this WebRTC proof of concept!
